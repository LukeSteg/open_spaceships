# open_spaceships
Creators: Luke Stegman, Adam Kimble

open_spaceships is (going to be) an open source, spaceship bridge simulator game. (think star trek)
Currently, we are working on getting the engine up and working. Expect regular Monday updates.

If you want to demo this, you should do so on a computer running linux and have SDL2 and SDL_image 2.0 installed. forewarning: the engine does not currently display anyting of note to the screen.

This game came about after playing Artemis, another spaceship bridge game. I enjoyed the game very much, but it was also lacking in a lot of ways; 2d navigation, windows only, etc. So I thought why not make a better version with all of the features I want. Why not make it open source and native to linux to take advantage of the nerdy computer people who would love this kind of game. So that lead to where Adam and I are now. 

Notable planned features
  controls of a single spaceship distributed across multiple networked computers
  cross platform (in theory. however we are coding with a focus on linux)
  full 3d navigation
  3d graphics
  random window title suffixes

So far, the game engine uses SDL2 and OpenGl. Those together should have mose of what we need but we will add new technologies as we need them

let us know if you think this is a game that you think is worth playing. That would mean a lot to us
